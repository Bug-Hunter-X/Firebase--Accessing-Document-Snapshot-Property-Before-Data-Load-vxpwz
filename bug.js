The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This can happen if you try to access the data within a callback function that executes before the data has finished downloading from the database. For example, if you have asynchronous operation that is not handled correctly, you may experience this bug. Consider the following code snippet:
```javascript
db.collection('users').doc('someId').get().then((doc) => {
  console.log(doc.data().name); // This might throw an error if doc.data() is null
});
```
